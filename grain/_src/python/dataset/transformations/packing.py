  """Implements first-fit packing of sequences.

  Packing, compared to concat-and-split, avoids splitting sequences by padding
  instead. Larger number of packing bins reduce the amount of padding. If the
  number of bins is large, this can cause epoch leakage (data points from
  multiple epochs getting packed together).

  This uses a simple first-fit packing algorithm that:
  1. Creates N bins.
  2. Adds elements (in the order coming from the parent) to the first bin that
  has enough space.
  3. Once an element doesn't fit, emits all N bins as elements.
  4. (optional) Shuffles bins.
  5. Loops back to 1 and starts with the element that didn't fit.

  This iterator is easy to make deterministic, but it has the downside that some
  bins (usually the bottom bins) have a lot of padding. To avoid this pattern,
  we add an option to shuffle the bins before emitting.
