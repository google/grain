"""This module provides a helper class for multi-bin first-fit packing.

Example packing is a step in many input pipelines for sequence to sequence
models where multiple examples are packed together as a single example in order
to maximise data fed to a TPU per batch. Our approach is implemented in pure
Python (thus easy to extend/ modify) and supports N-dimensional input features.

Note on the packing algorithm: We perform online packing. We start by
constructing an empty batch of "num_packing_bins" rows. For each input example,
we try to find the first row in the batch where it can be added. If the new
example can't be added, we construct a new batch to which the element is added.
This is equivalent to first-fit bin backing
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-fit_bin_packing).
