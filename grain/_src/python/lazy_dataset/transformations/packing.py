  """Packs potentially multiple examples from the parent into a single example.

  This is one implementation of the often called "example packing"
  transformation. The parent produces examples that contain sequences of
  variable length and this transformations outputs examples of the desired
  sequence length while minizing the amound of padding.

  # Properties of SingleBinPack:
  SingleBinPack packs a single example at a time and passes through any examples
  that seem already packed.
  When only single features is packed this produces 0 padding. However some
  examples will be truncated. And when the parent iterator is exhausted the
  remaining examples in the buffer will be packed together and padded to form
  a full packed example.

  # Details
  The `length_struct` should have the same structure as examples from the
  parent and provide is desired sequence length. The sequence length of
  a features is the size of its first dimension. If the desired sequence
  length is `None` the feature will not be packed and the output will just
  contain a list of the features the individual examples.

  Warning: Make sure that examples from the `parent` have the same structure
  as `length_struct`. Python containers such as lists are not considered leafs -
  NumPy array are.

  For packed features the output will have the desired feature length by
  combining multiple examples. If there is only a single packed feature it is
  guarantee to not contain padding.
  Warning: When combining examples that add up to a sequence longer than the
  target sequence length the remainder of the last example will be dropped!
  (This could be changed by improving the implementation.)

  As common each packed feature there will have 3 outputs:
  - The concatenated values.
  - The segmentation that indicate the different examples.
  - The positions of values within each example.

  If the input is a flat dictionaries segmentations and positions will be added
  as new entries. Otherwise the output will contain tuples (value, segmentation,
  positions).
