"""This module provides an implementation for example packing in pure python.

Example packing is a step in many input pipelines for sequence to sequence
models where multiple examples are packed together as a single example in order
to maximise data fed to a TPU per batch. Our approach is implemented in pure
Python (thus easy to extend/ modify) and supports N-dimensional input features.

Note on the packing algorithm: We perform online packing. We start by
constructing an empty batch of "batch_size" rows. For each input example, we
try to find the first row in the batch where it can be added. If the new example
can't be added, we construct a new batch to which the element is added.

  Attributes:
    batch_size: int, the batch size.
    length_struct: A pytree, with the same structure as `input_iterator`
      elements, but where leaves are ints, representing the packed length of the
      corresponding feature.

  __call__() takes an input iterator, where elements are `Record`s containing:

    input_data: Pytrees of arrays. For more info about PyTrees, please refer to:
      https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html. Packed leaves should be
      n-dimensional arrays, with sequence length as the leading dimension, i.e.
      shape (T_in, ...), where T_in < T_packed. Note that leaves can and will
      often have ragged length dimensions across different elements of the input
      iterator.

  The output of __call__() will be an iterator over `Record`s containing a
  3-tuple of Pytrees. These are:

    data: The batched and packed data. This is a Pytree with parallel structure
      to elements of `input_iterator`. Leaves have shape (B, T_packed, ...).
    segmentations: Pytree with the same structure as `data`, and leaves of shape
      (B, T). Represents which example each entry comes from. This may be used
      for Transformer attention masks, for example.
    positions: Pytree with the same structure as `data`, and leaves of shape
      (B, T). Represents the position of each entry within their original
      example. This may be used e.g. in Transformer absolute position
      embeddings.
