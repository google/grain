"""This module contains implementations for various data sources.

Data source is an abstraction that is responsible for retrieving data records
from storage backend (e.g. a set of files, a database). It is used by the
DataTransformer to load data records. In V1 of the python backend, we focus on
data sources based on storage backends allowing efficient random access
(e.g. ArrayRecord files.) This allowshaving deterministic and preemtable input
pipelines.
