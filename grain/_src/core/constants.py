# Below are names of meta features used by index_dataset (and pipelines building
# on top of it). These features are generated on the fly and help to track
# progress over the dataset. Users can read these but shouldn't alter them. They
# start with "_" to indicate that they are "private".
# Index into the stream of all records (globally unique). Starts with 0.
INDEX = "_index"
# Key of the record. If DATASET_INDEX is present it's the key in the dataset.
# Starts with 0.
RECORD_KEY = "_record_key"
# Index of the dataset from which to take the record. Only present when mixing.
# Starts with 0.
DATASET_INDEX = "_dataset_index"
# Epoch for the record. When mixing datasets this is the epoch over the dataset,
# not the mixture. Starts with 1.
EPOCH = "_epoch"
# Random seed for stateless random operations. This is unique per record
# and changes every epoch.
SEED = "_seed"
# Serialized record.
RECORD = "_record"
