"""Type definition and methods for handling random numbers.

Grain uses counter-based pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) for fast and
reproducible random numbers.
This means that there is no global random seed or a global stateful PRNGs
object. Instead, random seeds are always passed explicitly and users should
understand the rules outlined below (this applies both to the internals of
Grain as well as user defined preprocessing and extensions).

## Motivation
We want Grain input pipelines to be reproducible while still being highly
parallelizable. This very much overlaps with the design choices for JAX's PRNG
([design notes](github.com/google/jax/blob/main/docs/design_notes/prng.md)) and
their choice for counter-based PRNGs like ThreeFry and Philox.
NumPy, JAX and TF all contain implementations of ThreeFry/Philox.

## General Rules
If you are not familiar with `jax.random`, we recommend reading
[the JAX
documentation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#random-numbers)
or
[this
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/jax/blob/main/docs/jax-101/05-random-numbers.ipynb).
to understand the concepts of counter-based PRNGs. You should be comfortable
with splitting your random seeds.

After that, just follow these rules:
- Never use the `random` module from the Python standard library.
- Either use methods in `jax.random`, random methods in TensorFlow that start
  with `stateless_` (e.g. `tf.random.stateless_uniform()`) or non-global
  NumPy random generators.
- Do not use the global RNG in `np.random`. Instead create a new generator
  with appropiate bit generator: `np.random.default_rng(seed)` or
  `np.random.Generator(np.random.Philox(seed))` and call random functions on it.
  The generator (or more accurately the underlying bit generator) is stateful
  and should not be used across between threads.
- If you want to use a new random seed each time your program starts, you can
  use `int.from_bytes(os.urandom(4), sys.byteorder)` and log the value.
- Do not re-use a random seed. Instead, split the random seed using
  `jax.random.split()` or `tf.random.experimental.stateless_split()`

## JAX
JAX supports multiple RNG implementations. Since Grain operations run on CPU,
we recommend the default (ThreeFry). It's stable across JAX/XLA versions.
Internally, ThreeFry uses a uint32 type vector of shape [2] as state.

## NumPy
NumPy contains several suitable RNG implementations (aka bit generators). We
recommend using `np.random.Philox` which is very similar to the ThreeFry
implementation in JAX and TF. However `PCG64` (default as of writting) and
`PCG64DXSM` are also suitable for input pipelines. Just don't use the global
RNG and always construct your own `np.random.Generator`.

## TensorFlow
TensorFlow implements multiple counter-based RNGs (ThreeFry and Philox) but
doesn't provide any guidance on which one to use. We recommend to not set the
algorithm explicitly and let TF select the RNG (on CPUs it seems to select
Philox). You can derive a random seed for stateless random functions using
`tf.random.Generator.from_seed(my_integer).make_seeds(1)[:, 0]`.
Splitting seeds can be done using:
```
seed, seed_for_my_op = tf.unstack(tf.random.experimental.stateless_split(seed))
```
