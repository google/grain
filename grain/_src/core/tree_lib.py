"""Utilities for working with pytrees.

See https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html for more details about
pytrees.

This module merely re-directs imports of the actual implementations. To avoid a
direct dependency on JAX, we check if it's already present and resort to the
`tree` package otherwise.

We should be able to remove this module once b/257971667 is resolved.
