"""Abstract base classes for common types of transformations.

The idea is to implement atomic chunks of transformations as subclasses of
the base classes below (examples: resize image, tokenize text, add padding).
- More complex transformations can be created by chaining multiple
  transformations.
- It's recommended that subclasses are dataclasses.
- Libraries applying transformations can use these base classes to correctly
  apply transformations as part of Beam pipelines, data ingestion pipelines etc.
